# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hello, I'm Aron Van Daele!<br><br>

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Information Technology at Hogeschool Gent, specializing in Systems and Network Management (2022 – Present). Previously, I obtained my secondary education diploma in Economics and Modern Languages from Sint-Vincentius Instituut Gijzegem (2016 – 2022).<br><br>

Throughout my education, I've actively participated in various practical projects, enhancing my technical expertise and soft skills:<br><br>

🚀 **System Development Project:**<br>
In my first year, I collaborated with three fellow students to analyze, design, and develop the game "Splendor." We held weekly meetings to discuss progress and challenges, ultimately presenting a functional and technically sound project. Through this project, I gained hands-on programming experience with Java and JavaScript. Additionally, I developed essential skills in software analysis, including the creation of domain models and other analysis methodologies.<br><br>

🚀 **System Engineering Project:**<br>
During my second year, as part of a five-person team, I was responsible for designing and implementing a complete network infrastructure, including servers and related functionalities. This involved preparing material estimates, meeting deadlines, regular follow-ups, and demos, while using GitHub and Jira for version control and project management. I primarily learned how to set up and configure various infrastructure components, such as Windows servers and clients, web servers, and other core network services.<br><br>

🚀 **Real-life Integrated Software Engineering / DevOps Project:**<br>
In my third year, I joined a DevOps team with three other students, closely collaborating with seven developers. My focus was on managing database infrastructure using PostgreSQL, handling setup, maintenance, security, and backups. I also ensured stable and efficient infrastructure for application deployment, utilizing GitHub and Jira extensively.<br><br>

🚀 **Internship at Integr8 Consulting (i8c):**<br>
Since February 2025, I've been interning at Integr8 Consulting (i8c), working on systems integration and automation. My tasks include developing custom connectors using the Workato Connector SDK and programming in Ruby, integrating various business applications and gaining valuable industry experience. Additionally, I gained exposure to the AI Gateway collection within Workato, allowing integration with Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to facilitate automated API calls.<br><br>
